                    <p>Atlassian Cloud is the hosting platform designed and used by us to deliver Atlassian applications
                        as a service. Each subscriber's Atlassian Cloud applications are physically located on a server
                        in a dedicated, locked cage at our data center partners. Our data center partners provide power,
                        network and backup services. Atlassian owns the servers and is responsible for provisioning,
                        monitoring, and managing the servers, and for providing support to Atlassian Cloud
                        subscribers.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <h3>Data storage</h3>

                    <p>Our Atlassian Cloud platform was designed and optimized by us specifically to host Atlassian
                        applications and has multiple levels of redundancy built in. The applications themselves run on
                        a separate front-end hardware node than that on which the data is stored. Hardware failure of
                        the compute node is recovered automatically. Application data is stored on a RAID 10 (mirrored
                        and striped) storage node which is replicated to a secondary storage node every four hours. If
                        the primary storage node has a problem or becomes unavailable, the applications can be switched
                        over to the secondary storage node.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <h3>Facilities</h3>

                    <p>Access to the data centers is limited to authorized personnel only, as verified by biometric
                        identity verification measures. Physical security measures include: on-premises security guards,
                        closed circuit video monitoring, man traps, and additional intrusion protection measures. Within
                        the data center, all Atlassian equipment is stored in locked cages designed to be
                        earthquake-proof.</p>

                    <p>Our data centres are located in geographically diverse locations across the United States.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <h3>People and access</h3>

                    <p>Our global support team maintains an account on all cloud systems and applications for the
                        purposes of maintenance and support. This support team accesses hosted applications and data
                        only for purposes of application health monitoring and performing system or application
                        maintenance, and upon customer request via our support system. Within Atlassian, only authorized
                        Atlassian employees have access to application data. Authentication is done via individual
                        passphrase-protected public keys, rather than passwords, and the servers only accept incoming
                        SSH connections from Atlassian and internal data center locations. Atlassian Cloud is designed
                        to allow application data to be accessible only with appropriate credentials, such that one
                        customer cannot access another customer's data without explicit knowledge of that other
                        customers' login information. Customers are responsible for maintaining the security of their
                        own login information.</p>

                    <p>The Atlassian operations team monitors the Atlassian Cloud platform 24x7 from operation centers
                        in Sydney, San Francisco, and Amsterdam. Information about system uptime is publicly <a
                                href="https://www.atlassian.com/cloud/status">available here</a>.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <h3>Certification</h3>

                    <p>To augment 3rd party application penetration testing we have performed, we have selected data
                        center providers that maintain industry-standard certifications.</p>

                    <p>Our data centers are SOC-1 (formerly SAS 70) compliant. These certifications address physical
                        security, system availability, network and IP backbone access, customer provisioning and problem
                        management.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <h3>Backups</h3>

                    <p>Application database backups for Atlassian Cloud occur on the following frequencies: On-site
                        backups are performed daily and retained for seven days; Tape backups are taken weekly, which
                        are then stored off-site and retained for four weeks. All backup data is encrypted.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <h3>Privacy</h3>

                    <p>Atlassian understands the importance of ensuring the privacy of your personally identifiable
                        information. For more information, please see our <a
                                href="https://www.atlassian.com/company/privacy">Privacy Statement</a>.</p>

                    <p>NOTE: This Security Statement applies to the Atlassian Cloud service. For questions regarding
                        Atlassian's legacy hosted services (such as JIRA Studio, JIRA Enterprise Hosted and Confluence
